# M0_Simple_Synth_06

Continuation of the last sketch, but with two circuits.

The basic equivalent is something in this direction.  Not exactly...but close.

In this case, really, the switch to turn the LFO off and on is really stuck to ON...and we will be playing with that later.  But feel free to tweek whatever.

In addition, I split up the files a bit.  In the Arduino IDE, its smart enough to combine all the files so long as one of them as the same name as the parent directory.  The order is Alphabetical from that point on so if you have compile issues, make sure you take that into account.

So there are 4 CC channels you need to use.  The easiest way is to probably just run the sketch and turn some knobs to find the values.  
Reassign in your code and recompile.

# Example

Example using the Arturia Beatstep and 4 knobs.
This runs into Ableton where it is broadcast to the Trinkek

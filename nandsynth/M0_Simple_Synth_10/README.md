# M0_Simple_Synth_09

This was an  experiment with a vibrato of sorts.
BAsically, you can incr or decr your bounds in the LFO loop for all kinds of neat effects.


In this case, I added it just to the first core to see what it sounds like.
I was planning on refactoring the code to put this in a loop, but did not have time
for that.

At this point, the code is pretty wacky/specialized anyways. 
We are no longer at a point where we are simulating a NAND circuit that much.

You can also have Ableton automate a lot of your steps

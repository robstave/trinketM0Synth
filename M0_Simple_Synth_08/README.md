# M0_Simple_Synth_08

Refactor.

This is the same sketch as the last one.
But I moved all the variables into a struct. 

There are many ways to do this.  Arrays, maps or whatever.
I decided to group all related variables in to a "core".

The advantages of this is that now you can really have as many cores as you want.
The disadvantage is that its still a little messy loading those cores with their intial values.

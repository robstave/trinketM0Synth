# M0_Simple_Synth_05

Nand Synth

So this is an approximation of the following circuit

The code is really not as complicated as it seems.  We are just really manipulating two counters and applying boolean logic to the results of the timers. The result is sent to a pin to make sound.

This approach has the flaws that were mentioned earlier that the resolution is not inear as we go up the scale.

For example:
If a particular note is generated by a counter counting up to 100, then when we reduce the counter to 50, we actually get a note that is an octave higher.

If you divide that counter amount by 2 again, you get another octave.  Works great, but notice the resolution gets worse too.

100 to 50 have 50 values
50 to 25 has 25
25 to 12.5 has 12 (rounded)

Also, with Midi, you only really get 128 values to send.  Technically, this is kinda a problem in the analog version too in that you often see a "corse" and "fine" knob.

Still, its a fun start and very 8-bity.

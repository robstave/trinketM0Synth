## trinketM0Synth

The purpose of this repo is to learn how to use the Adafruit Trinket MO as a MIDI device.  Im not really doing this as full blown tutorial, but rather, a notebook for what I learned.  I will capture as much as I can as I experiment using this as a Native USB MIDI device for both making sounds and as a controller.
